# Welcome to BeamDefence

Beam defence is an online multiplayer tower defence. It was really an experiment into whether SignalR communication could be sufficient for an online multiplayer game. It was hosted on Azure for a few weeks and proved to be a lot of fun and surprisingly playable once I introduced smoothing/extrapolation for the controls of other players.

Technologies used:
- C# .Net server
- SignalR for client/server communication
- Simple Angluar client with P5 used for visuals
- Azure for hosting
